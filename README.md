# Exploratory Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains a collection of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** projects performed on a variety of datasets from different domains. Each project is structured as a self-contained folder with relevant notebooks, code, and visualizations.

The goal of these projects is to extract insights, identify patterns, and understand the underlying structure of the data through various EDA techniques.

## 🔍 What You'll Find

- Cleaned and prepared datasets
- Visualizations using Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Summary statistics and trend analysis
- Feature understanding and data quality checks
- Well-commented Jupyter notebooks

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder inside the repository represents an independent EDA project and contains:

- A Jupyter notebook with the analysis
- The dataset used (or a link to it)
